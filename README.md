Sorting Algorithms:

Sorting algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science and are used to arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. There are various sorting algorithms, each with its strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.

Bubble Sort:

Description: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).
Selection Sort:

Description: Divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in all cases.
Insertion Sort:

Description: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking the next item and inserting it into its correct position.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case.
Merge Sort:

Description: Divides the array into two halves, sorts each half separately, and then merges them back together.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases.
Quick Sort:

Description: Chooses a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays such that elements less than the pivot are on the left and greater on the right. Recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, O(n log n) in the average and best cases.
Heap Sort:

Description: Builds a max (or min) heap from the array, repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element and rebuilds the heap until the array is sorted.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases.
Big O Notation:

Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound on the time or space complexity of an algorithm in terms of its input size. It helps to understand how the performance of an algorithm scales as the input size grows.

O(1): Constant Time - The algorithm's performance is constant and does not depend on the input size.
O(log n): Logarithmic Time - Common in algorithms that reduce the problem size in each step, like binary search.
O(n): Linear Time - The performance scales linearly with the size of the input.
O(n log n): Linearithmic Time - Common in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and heap sort.
O(n^2): Quadratic Time - Performance is proportional to the square of the input size. Common in inefficient sorting algorithms like bubble sort and selection sort.
O(2^n): Exponential Time - Performance doubles with each additional element in the input. Common in inefficient recursive algorithms without memoization.
O(n Factorial Time - The worst possible time complexity, often found in brute-force algorithms.
Remember, Big O notation describes the upper bound, and the actual performance may be better than the worst-case scenario. It provides a way to compare algorithms and understand their efficiency as the input size grows.
